ACS project
1) I had some trouble adding more than one table to the database. As a result, I decided to use one table that compared multiple groups. This table (B10053) looks at the prevalence of multiple subgroups among native born grandparents and foreign born grandparents.
2) I got the index page working with the drop down lists. For the compare page, I could not figure out how to join the columns being compared. The compare page prints out the state id and the tableid and columnid for the groups being compared.
3) In mysql I realize the actual data for the groups is missing although the data is there. At one point, I had to drop the database because I had entered the information twice. As a result, there was double everything. I think the data may have been deleted during that time. Not realizing this had happened, analysing the data in the app makepagefinal.py was not possible.
